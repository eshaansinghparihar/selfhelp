Ive always wondered what this book is about. The title is catchy and I loooooove Ferraris. Do you want one? I want one. Maybe that means this book is for you and me! Because Julian Mantle, the fictional, seven-figure-making lawyer this story is about, had one. And he was unhappy. So he sold it. It turns out, he didn?t need his Ferrari. He needed wisdom. So after he collapsed from all the stress with a heart attack, he sold everything and ventured into the Himalayan mountains. There, he found the Sages of Sivana, which taught him seven virtues, making him promise he?d pass on their teachings. Flowing through the quill of Robin Sharma, who published The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari in 1997, Julian did pass on what he learned. Over 6 million people have picked up his lessons. Today, I?d like to share 3 of them with you: Use The Heart of the Rose exercise to guard your mind against unwanted thoughts. Develop a simple 10-step morning routine with The Ten Rituals of Radiant Living. Selflessly serving others counterintuitively leaves you better off too. Ready for a short round of improvement? Lets see what we can learn from the monk who sold his Ferrari!
