      <p>In Q4 2013, after much fascination about web and playing with Photoshop to make layouts, I realised I had to learn HTML and CSS if I wanted to bring my designs to life. Turns out it took 1 day(5-6 hours) to learn the basics and 2 more days to be able to work my way around it. This is to show how easy it is to learn HTML and CSS. However, there is more to it and I'll discuss that later.

When I first started, I looked into W3schools and I didn't like the style. So I searched more and found a cool tutorial site HTML5 Tutorial | HTML 5 Tutorial.
I learned from there.

Before you start, you will need some tools:
1. A text editor. You can use the one that comes preloaded in your computer. In Windows it's Notepad or Wordpad, in Ubuntu it's gedit and I think Mac has TextMate. I personally use Sublime Text because it's really nice on my eyes. You could use Notepad++ or Dreamweaver(which is a paid one) or anything that suits you. There is a myriad of text editors online. I think most people use the ones I've mentioned here.</p>

A web browser (I'm not even sure if there was a point in putting that here haha). Well, in the beginning, it's not really going to matter, but as you progress, you will need to have different browsers to test your output. You will realize it soon enough that you have to install Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE, Edge or w.e browser there is to be able to see if your page is cross-browser compatible. Of course, by then you will realize that you can use frameworks to solve this problem.

Okay, now I'll give you some tips. I As mentioned above, I learned it pretty fast and so can you. The trick is that you need to write code while you learn. Some people might argue that they prefer read a whole chunk, then start writing code and go back if they don't remember. This doesn't work for me. I believe that practice while you read is the best way to get the information inside your head :)

From the link I posted above, you will see that the tutorials are very easy to read and provide you with simple code snippets that you need to type and see the output from your browser. So, start from with the basics, make sure you understand what's happening and work your way up. HTML is basically understanding how tags and nesting work. I'm pretty sure you learned basic sets in grade school. Basically HTML is like sets and subsets. You simply need to know visualize how nesting works. Once you can easily see the nesting, you're good to go :)

I learned basic CSS on W3schools. It was easy to test the CSS there. There are definitely more CSS resources and tutorials online for you to learn from, so I suggest find what works fr you. For CS, you just need to understand 2 things as a beginner: 
1. id 
2. class

The id is used for styling one thing whereas the class is used to style many different things. Let's take an example. If you have a main section and a comment section, you would want to have 2 different ids for each section so you can style them. Now you could have different texts on your page. Some could be used in the comment section, some could be used elsewhere. If you want to have the same font style for the same text at different places, then you use the class.
So simply think of the id as your ID. You can only have 1 ID number and not 2 different ones. Think of the class as your credit cards. You can have several credit cards that you use to buy the same stuff. That should cover the basics of CSS. Now you just have to apply the styling.

Once you have a grasp of the basics, it's time to build something worthwhile. In my case I had a design that i made in Photoshop and I really wanted to convert it to an actual HTML page, so I did that. This is the part where you learn the most, because that's when you will realize that you can't do something and you have to Google a solution. That's completely fine. That's how you learn. You'll use Stackoverflow a lot and you will realize that most of your questions have already been answered with a solution. So that's how you get better at it. 

Once you manage to build a decent page, you can start looking at Web Design Inspiration websites which showcase some amazingly well-designed websites and you can learn from there as well. See how they do it and try to make something similar(for educational purposes only.</p>

      <p> That's completely fine. That's how you learn. You'll use Stackoverflow a lot and you will realize that most of your questions have already been answered with a solution. So that's how you get better at it. Once you manage to build a decent page, you can start looking at Web Design Inspiration websites which showcase some amazingly well-designed websites and you can learn from there as well. See how they do it and try to make something similar(for educational purposes only. Note that it's unethical to copy someone else work and label it as your own.) I guess if you put 4-5 hours per day for a week, you should be good with the basics of HTML and CSS and be able to make some cool pages from scratch. After some good amount practice and making different types of websites, you will realize that sometimes your page looks perfect on one browser and not on another browser. That's fine. This is when you will start looking into cross-browser compatibilities and frameworks such as Bootstrap for example. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT learn Bootstrap first. A lot of people make this mistake. I believe that you should have a god grasp of the base and then move to frameworks. Your life will be way easier. But then, HTML and CSS are not really enough. Sometimes you will realize that you want to achieve something and it can't be done using only HTML and CSS. For example, you want to cool effects. So I suggest to learn Javascript once you feel you have a good base with HTML and CSS. And afterwards you can move to back-end with a language like PHP or Ruby. Both are very common lanaguages used these days. As you get more and more advanced look into stuff like Node.js or Angular.
